# Daily Wallpaper

> Please give me a star.

每天爬取Bing的图片，下载后并自动设置成壁纸。

有一些功能写的不是很好。

由于Bing接口限制，所以每天只有八张壁纸。🙄

源码写的很乱，建议用就行，还是别改了。😂

（对了，软件UI的实现很骚，建议别学）😅

使用方法：

- 📐想要改源码的，就下载Daily Wallpaper文件夹，然后导入到VS就行🚲[直达](https://github.com/FengZi-lv/Daily_Wallpaper/tree/main/Daily%20Wallpaper)
- 📏单纯使用的，就下载Daily Wallpaper Setup文件夹，然后打开里面的软件就可以🏍[直达](https://github.com/FengZi-lv/Daily_Wallpaper/tree/main/Daily%20Wallpaper)

Climb Bing images every day, download them and automatically set them to wallpaper.

Some of the features are not very well written.

Due to the Bing interface limitation, there are only eight wallpapers per day. 🙄

Source code is written very messy, it is recommended to use the line, or do not change. 😂

(by the way, the realization of software UI is very Sao, suggest not to learn) 😅

Usage:

- 📐 If you want to change the source code, just download the Daily Wallpaper folder and import it into VS to go directly to 🚲
- 📏 simple use, just download the Daily which Setup folder, and then the inside of the open software can 🏍 direct
